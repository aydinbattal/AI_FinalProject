Multiclass classification is a supervised machine learning technique where the goal is to classify instances into one of three or more classes. This experiment focuses on creating the best classification model for the red wine quality dataset using the pycaret library. Three classification models (Random Forest Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, Support Vector Machine) are tested in total. Results show that the Extra Trees Classifier has given the best accuracy after it has been tuned.
